  BASE

  A Base rule is applied to an element using an element selector, a
  descendent selector, or a child selector, along with any pseudo-classes.
  It doesnâ€™t include any class or ID selectors. It is defining the default
  styling for how that element should look in all occurrences on the page.

  LAYOUT

  Layout styles can also be divided into major and minor styles based on
  reuse. Major layout styles such as header and footer are traditionally
  styled using ID selectors but take the time to think about the elements
  that are common across all components of the page and use class selectors
  where appropriate.

  MODULES

  A Module is a more discrete component of the page. It is your
  navigation bars and your carousels and your dialogs and your widgets
  and so on. This is the meat of the page.

  Modules sit inside Layout components.
  Modules can sometimes sit within other Modules, too.

  Each Module should be designed to exist as a standalone
  component. In doing so, the page will be more flexible. If done right,
  Modules can easily be moved to different parts of the layout without
  breaking.

  When defining the rule set for a module, avoid using IDs and element
  selectors, sticking only to class names. A module will likely contain a
  number of elements and there is likely to be a desire to use descendent
  or child selectors to target those elements.
